# Smoothini
This is a website for a fictional smoothie company. My roommate told me about this idea one day, and I decided to build it! It was designed with mobile in mind, but works best as point and click. The main idea is this site would be a full page webapp on an iPad in the store from which you could fully order your smoothie, no fuss.

It has a full selection of ingredients with categories that you can drill down into to get to specific ingredients. It also has a search bar from which you can directly add ingredients too. There is also a fully functional cart that tracks everything you've added and calculates the total price of the smoothie.

There is also an about page that includes some humorous information about the fictional company.

It uses AngularJS, some jQuery, Bootstrap, and several libraries. Simple http get call to a JSON file to get the ingredient data.
